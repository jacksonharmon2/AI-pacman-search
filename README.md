# AI Pacman Search

This project contains implementations of search algorithms for the Pacman AI framework.  
It is part of a lab/assignment on search strategies and demonstrates how algorithms work in a grid-based environment.

## üìÇ Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore classic search algorithms by applying them to Pacman mazes.  
Algorithms implemented include:
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
- A* Search with heuristics
